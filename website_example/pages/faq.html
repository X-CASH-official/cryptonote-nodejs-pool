<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>

<h4 class="push-up-20" tkey="faq1_title">What is difficulty?</h4>
<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10" tkey="faq1_text">Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target.</div>

<h4 tkey="faq2_title">What is luck?</h4>
<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10" tkey="faq2_text">Mining is probabilistic in nature: if you find a block earlier than you statistically should on average you are lucky if it takes longer, you are unlucky. In a perfect world, the pool would find a block on 100% luck value. Less then 100% means the pool was lucky. More then 100% means the pool was unlucky.</div>

<h4 tkey="faq3_title">What is a share?</h4>
<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10" tkey="faq3_text">A share is a possible valid hash for the block. Shares are sent from your rigs to the pool to prove their work.</div>

<h4 tkey="faq4_title">What is a block?<h4>
<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10" tkey="faq4_text">Transaction data is recorded in blocks. New transactions are being processed by miners into new blocks, which are added to the end of the blockchain.</div>

<h4 tkey="faq5_title">How long does it take to find a block?</h4>
<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10" tkey="faq5_text">It depends on amount of active miners. The more miners work on pool &rarr; the more hashrate pool has &rarr; the more blocks are found by the pool. However the more miners are active &rarr; the less reward you get from each block found.</div>

<h4 tkey="faq6_title">What payout scheme is used?</h4>
<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10" tkey="faq6_text">Proportional (Share-based): Every time a block is found, its reward is split between miners according to the number of shares they submitted.</div>

<h4 tkey="faq7_title">How is the current payout estimate calculated?</h4>
<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10" tkey="faq7_text">The estimated payout is calculated using your percentage of valid shares on the total for current round. This percentage is then applied to the reward of the last block found by the network.</div>
